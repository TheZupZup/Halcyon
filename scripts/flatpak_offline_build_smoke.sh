# This deliberately separates the only networked phase (flatpak-builder
# fetching manifest-declared sources) from the build phase. If pub, CMake, a
# plugin, or another build command tries to fetch something undeclared, the
# second phase fails instead of quietly using the network or a developer cache.

# archives and possibly a finished bundle; a repo-root `.pub-cache` carries
# packages pub could resolve from. Those arrive as *source*, so neither
# --disable-cache (which only stops module build results being restored) nor
# --disable-download (which only stops declared sources being fetched) keeps
# them out. Refuse to run rather than print a PASS that proves less than it
