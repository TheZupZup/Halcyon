"""A source-pattern tripwire for the Cast security containment.

Casting is withheld from production builds while a reported security issue is
resolved (see lib/core/services/cast/cast_containment.dart and docs/cast.md).
This script greps four files for the markers of the three layers that hold that
in place: the `isActive` constant, the production override binding, the absence
of a live backend in the cast provider wiring, and the transport's own guards.

WHAT THIS IS NOT
----------------
This is NOT proof that casting cannot be reached, and it must not be described
as one. It is a set of regexes over four known files, so it catches the obvious
regression — someone flips the constant, drops the override, reverts the
provider, deletes a guard — and nothing subtler. It cannot see:

  * a bypass that keeps every marker in place, such as a new CastService
    implementation, a second override applied after this one, a live transport
    constructed somewhere other than cast_providers.dart, or a guard left intact
    while the code path around it moves;
  * anything in a file this script does not read, including new files;
  * a guard that is present but no longer reachable, or a constant read through
    an indirection this script does not resolve;
  * the actual runtime behaviour of any of it, since nothing here executes the
    app.

WHAT IS THE EVIDENCE
--------------------
The tests are. test/app/production_cast_containment_test.dart builds the real
production override list per platform and drives the resulting service;
test/core/services/cast/cast_containment_test.dart calls the transport directly.
Those exercise behaviour rather than text. Treat a green run of this script as
"the markers we know to look for are still there", and treat a red one as a
question that needs answering before merge.

Ambiguity fails closed: a missing file, an unreadable file, or a pattern this
script no longer recognises exits non-zero rather than reporting success. That
is a property of this script's own inputs, not a guarantee about the app.

When the reviewed restoration lands, this script is updated in the same pull
request — that edit is one of the signals a reviewer looks for.
