/// The fail-closed half of the Cast security containment.
///
/// Production binds an inert service, so these paths are unreachable in a
/// shipped build — which is the point of testing them. They are the safety net
/// under the wiring: if the provider is ever reverted, injected around, or
/// restored early, the transport itself must still refuse to reach a device.
///
/// **A known gap.** The third layer — the session handle's own refusal — has no
/// test here: the handle is private and only [ChromecastCastTransport.connect]
/// hands one out, so a test cannot obtain one while contained. That layer is
/// therefore covered only by reading the code and by the marker check in
/// `scripts/check_cast_containment.py`, which is a source-pattern tripwire
/// rather than proof. It is a backstop behind two layers that *are* exercised
/// here and in test/app/production_cast_containment_test.dart, not the thing
/// containment rests on.
