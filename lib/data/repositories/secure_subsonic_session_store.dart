/// A [SubsonicSessionStore] backed by `flutter_secure_storage`.
///
/// The session is serialized to JSON and written to platform secure storage
/// under a single key: the Android Keystore-backed store on Android, and the
/// freedesktop Secret Service (libsecret) on Linux, i.e. the desktop keyring
/// the user's other apps already use. The credential (salt + token) is never
/// at rest in plaintext (unlike `shared_preferences`) on either platform, and
/// there is no file
/// fallback when the platform store is unavailable. This is the production
/// binding; it's intentionally never touched by tests, which use the in-memory
/// store so they stay free of platform channels.
///
/// A malformed/partial record reads back as `null` (treated as "signed out")
/// rather than throwing, so a storage glitch can't wedge the app at launch. A
/// keyring that is missing, locked or denied is a different thing and is not
/// flattened into "signed out": [SecureSessionStorage] surfaces it as a
/// `SecureStorageException`, which the caller reports so the user can act on
/// it (unlock the keyring, sign in again) instead of losing the credential
/// silently.
