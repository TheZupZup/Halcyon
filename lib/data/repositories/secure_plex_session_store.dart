/// A [PlexSessionStore] backed by `flutter_secure_storage`.
///
/// The session is serialized to JSON and written to platform secure storage
/// under a single key, through [SecureSessionStorage]: the Android
/// Keystore-backed store on Android, and libsecret on Linux (the freedesktop
/// Secret Service natively; inside a Flatpak, libsecret's own portal-keyed
/// encrypted store). The server-scoped token is never at rest in plaintext
/// (unlike `shared_preferences`) on either platform, and Linthra writes no
/// file of its
/// own when the platform store is unavailable. This is the production binding;
/// it's intentionally never touched by tests, which use the in-memory store so
/// they stay free of platform channels.
///
/// A malformed/partial record reads back as `null` (treated as "signed out")
/// rather than throwing, so a storage glitch can't wedge the app at launch. A
/// platform store that is missing, locked or denied is a different thing and is
/// not flattened into "signed out": [SecureSessionStorage] surfaces it as a
/// `SecureStorageException`, which the caller reports so the user can act on
/// it (unlock the keyring, sign in again) instead of losing the credential
/// silently.
