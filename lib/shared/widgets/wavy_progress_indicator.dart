/// Progress drawn along a gentle horizontal wave instead of a flat bar.
///
/// The elapsed part of the track is a soft serpentine line in [activeColor];
/// the remainder is a calm straight line in [inactiveColor], with an optional
/// round marker riding the boundary between them. The wave's amplitude eases to
/// zero at both ends of the elapsed segment, so it grows out of — and settles
/// back into — the flat line rather than looking cut off.
///
/// This widget is purely presentational: it knows about a [value] in `0..1` and
/// nothing about playback, seeking, or `Duration`. That keeps it reusable for
/// any "progress along a line" surface (the now-playing bar, the mini-player's
/// top edge) and keeps the interaction and semantics with the caller — see
/// `WavySeekBar` for the seekable, screen-reader-friendly wrapper.
///
/// **There is deliberately no perpetual animation here.** A wave that drifts
/// forever would repaint the full width of the bar on every frame, on the
/// screen users leave open the longest — the opposite of what a low-end phone
/// wants, and something `docs/battery.md` rules out for the rest of the UI. The
/// only motion is a one-shot ease when [active] flips: the wave swells to full
/// [amplitude] while progress is advancing and settles back to a calmer,
/// shallower wave at rest. That transition takes [transitionDuration], then the
/// widget stops scheduling frames entirely, and it is skipped outright when the
/// platform or user asks for reduced motion
/// ([MediaQueryData.disableAnimations]). A bar whose [active] never changes —
/// the mini-player's — costs exactly one paint per position tick.
