/// that works in *both* Linux builds — a plain GTK dialog natively, and the
/// xdg-desktop-portal chooser inside the Flatpak, where `file_picker`'s
/// `zenity`/`kdialog` binaries do not exist (#438). The plugin chooser is kept
/// only for a build that has no such channel registered (a `flutter test` host,
/// or an older runner), so nothing regresses if the native half is missing.
///
/// A cancel is never a fallback: only [FolderPickerUnavailableException] — "no
/// chooser here" — moves on to the plugin, so cancelling never pops a second
/// dialog.
