/// The readiness boundary casting has to cross before a receiver gets anything:
/// a [CastTransport] that hands out a session only once the receiver on the
/// other end has proved, *on that session*, that it is the device the user
/// picked.
///
/// It is a decorator, not a transport: it opens no socket and speaks no
/// protocol. That is deliberate. The rule — *no verified identity, no session,
/// no media* — is policy, and policy that lives inside an I/O adapter can only
/// be tested on a device. Here it is a few dozen lines of orchestration over a
/// [CastTransport] and a [CastReceiverAuthenticator], so every failure the
/// boundary must survive (a refusal, a device answering for another device, a
/// proof made over some other connection, an authentication that never
/// finishes, a session that dies mid-handshake or after it) is a unit test
/// rather than a code review.
///
/// It also owns what the user is told. A refusal keeps its
/// [CastTrustFailureKind] and nothing else: the message the sheet shows is
/// written here, so no message an authenticator produces — which may have been
/// built from something the receiver said — can reach the UI.
///
/// **This does not restore casting.** Nothing in production builds a live
/// transport while the security containment holds, and the shipped
/// [UnverifiedCastReceiverAuthenticator] refuses every receiver anyway. This is
/// the boundary the reviewed restoration
/// ([#575](https://github.com/TheZupZup/Linthra/issues/575)) has to plug a real
/// authenticator into, built and tested ahead of it rather than alongside it.
///
/// **Containment still comes first.** Trust is checked *after* the delegate
/// opens the session, because a receiver can only prove itself over a
/// connection. So a contained transport refuses before this class ever asks
/// about identity, and this class never becomes a second way to reach a device
/// that the transport itself would not reach.
