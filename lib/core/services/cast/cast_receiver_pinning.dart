/// question than people assume. Cast's device authentication proves that the
/// thing on the other end holds a manufacturer certificate chaining to a Cast
/// root: it is a real, licensed receiver. It does not prove that it is the
/// receiver the user meant. Discovery is a name and an address on a LAN, both
/// unauthenticated, so a second genuine receiver (a neighbour's, a guest's, one
/// plugged in by someone else on the same network) can answer to a familiar
/// name and pass authentication honestly.
///
/// Pinning closes that gap the only way a client can: the first time a device is
/// used, the fingerprint of the certificate it proved itself with is recorded
/// against it; every later connection has to present the same one. It is
/// trust-on-first-use, with all of that model's limits (see
/// docs/cast-hardened-design.md), and it is still the difference between
/// noticing a swapped receiver and never being able to.
///
/// Fingerprints are not secrets. They are digests of a certificate the device
/// hands to anyone who connects, so a store needs no encryption, only
/// integrity and an answer the app can rely on.
