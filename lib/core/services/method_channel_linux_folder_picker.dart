/// A [FolderPickerService] that opens the desktop folder chooser through
/// Linthra's own Linux runner channel (`linux/runner/folder_picker_channel.cc`)
/// and returns the chosen folder's filesystem path.
///
/// This exists for the Flatpak (#438). The `file_picker` plugin's Linux
/// implementation shells out to `zenity`/`qarma`/`kdialog`; none of those
/// binaries exist inside the sandbox, so a Flatpak pick failed before any
/// dialog appeared. The runner instead uses GTK's `GtkFileChooserNative`, which
/// GTK routes to the **xdg-desktop-portal** FileChooser when the app is
/// sandboxed and draws in-process otherwise — so one path serves both builds:
///
///  - Native Linux: the ordinary GTK folder dialog, returning a real path.
///  - Flatpak: the portal runs the chooser on the host, and the folder the user
///    picked comes back as a document-portal path (under `/run/user/…/doc/…`)
///    that the sandbox may read. The user's explicit choice *is* the grant, so
///    no `--filesystem=` permission is needed, and the grant persists across
///    restarts for as long as the document store keeps it.
///
/// Off Linux, or on a build whose runner did not register the channel, it
/// throws [FolderPickerUnavailableException] so [LinuxFolderPickerService] can
/// fall back to the plugin chooser instead of reporting a cancel.
