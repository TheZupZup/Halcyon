/// On Android it uses [MethodChannelSafFolderPicker], which returns the picked
/// `content://` tree URI with a persisted read grant — the scoped-storage-
/// correct selection. On Linux it uses [LinuxFolderPickerService], the runner's
/// GTK chooser, which GTK routes through xdg-desktop-portal inside the Flatpak
/// and draws in-process on a native build (#438). Everywhere else (the other
/// desktops, where the chooser returns a real filesystem path) it uses the
/// `file_picker`-backed [FilePickerFolderPickerService]. This is the one place
/// that knows about the platform split, mirroring [PlatformAudioFileScanner] on
