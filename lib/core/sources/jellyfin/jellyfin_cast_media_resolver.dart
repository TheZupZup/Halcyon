/// demand at cast time, with the token woven in by the source and never stored
/// on the track or in the catalog. The receiver fetches that URL directly, so a
/// Jellyfin track casts as a live stream — including one that also has an
/// offline copy, since a receiver can't read the on-device file but can reach
/// the server.
///
/// The minted URL (token and all) is placed only on the returned [CastMedia],
/// which is handed straight to the cast session and never logged or persisted.
/// The only thing logged here is the secret-free [PlaybackDiagnostics] line,
/// whose API has no parameter for a token or full URL.

  /// accepts for a client that is not sending headers. There is no per-item
  /// signed URL, no scoped download token, and no server-side expiry to ask for
  /// in the stable API, so a receiver handed this URL is handed account-level
  /// access.
  ///
  /// How long that access lasts is not the app's to say. Signing out of
  /// Jellyfin in Linthra forgets the token on this device; it does not ask the
  /// server to invalidate it, so a receiver that kept the URL keeps working
  /// until the user revokes that device in Jellyfin, or the server expires it
  /// on its own terms. Recording the lifetime as "until the user signs out"
  /// would be the comfortable answer and the wrong one.
  ///
  /// Declaring that plainly is the point: pretending a token in a query string
  /// is a capability would be inventing a restriction the server does not
  /// enforce. What Jellyfin would need for [CastMediaDelegation.scopedCapability]
